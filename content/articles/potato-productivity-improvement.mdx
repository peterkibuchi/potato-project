### Work Package 1: Potato Productivity Improvement Using High-Quality Seed & Climate-Smart Technologies

**Overview:**
The "Potato Project" aims to enhance potato farming in Kenya by improving productivity through the use of high-quality seed potatoes and climate-smart technologies. This initiative, led by a dedicated team of experts, focuses on innovative methods and technologies to address the challenges faced by potato farmers.

**The Team:**

- Prof. E.M. Ateka (Team Leader)
- Prof. J. Wesonga
- Dr. C. Wainaina
- Dr. L.K. Murungi
- C. Ngubia (MSc)
- S. Wairimu (MSc)
- D. Chepkoech (PhD)

**Key Activities:**

1. **Exploring New Seed Production Systems:**

   - **Tissue Culture and Micropropagation:** Developing protocols for the propagation of potato plants in a controlled environment to produce disease-free, high-quality seed potatoes.
   - **Biotization and Calcium Fortification:** Enhancing the nutritional content of seed potatoes to improve their growth and resilience.

2. **Pest and Disease Management:**

   - **Nematode and Bacterial Management:** Implementing strategies to control pests and diseases, such as the potato cyst nematode and bacterial wilt, that affect potato crops.

3. **Studies Conducted:**
   - **Study 1:** Optimization of in vitro regeneration, calcium fortification, and biotization of seed potatoes to enhance production.
   - **Study 2:** Climate vulnerability and ecosystem mapping assessment for the Irish potato value chain in Nyandarua County.
   - **Study 3:** Validation of the "wrap and plant" technology in the management of Globodera spp. in potatoes.

**Component Activities:**

- **Micropropagation Protocol Development:** Establishing efficient methods for producing large quantities of high-quality seed potatoes.
- **Micro-tuberization and Agronomic Fortification:** Fortifying potato tubers with essential nutrients to enhance their growth and yield.
- **Infection and Disease Management:** Conducting trials to understand and mitigate the effects of bacterial wilt and other diseases on potato plants.

**Key Achievements:**

- **Calcium Fortification Protocol:** Successfully developed a protocol for fortifying seed potatoes with calcium, which improves their quality and growth potential.
- **Research Presentations:** Presented findings at various workshops and summits, receiving recognition for the innovative approaches and results achieved.
- **Manuscript Development:** Ongoing work to publish research findings and share knowledge with the broader scientific community.

**Ongoing and Future Work:**

- **Data Collection for Greenhouse Trials:** Continuing experiments to gather data on the effectiveness of different fortification and biotization methods.
- **Thesis Write-up:** Preparing comprehensive reports and theses based on the research conducted to contribute to academic knowledge and practical applications in potato farming.

This work package is a crucial part of the Potato Project, addressing the core issues of seed quality and climate resilience in potato farming. By implementing these innovative techniques, the team aims to significantly improve potato productivity and contribute to the overall sustainability and profitability of potato farming in Kenya.
