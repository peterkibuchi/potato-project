## Potato Value Chain Project: Goals, Problems, and Solutions

### Goals of the Project

The Potato Value Chain Project aims to transform the potato farming industry in Kenya by enhancing various aspects of production, post-harvest handling, value addition, market access, and mechanization. The primary goal is to strengthen the potato value chain through the use of climate-smart technologies and innovative ICT tools. Specific objectives include:

1. Improving potato production with high-quality seeds and climate-smart technologies.
2. Enhancing storage quality, nutrition, safety, and market competitiveness of potato products.
3. Increasing the contribution of potatoes to human nutrition and health.
4. Evaluating mechanisms for strengthening the potato value chain in Kenya.
5. Enhancing mechanization for soil sampling, planting, harvesting, storage, sorting, grading, and processing.
6. Integrating ICT and mobile technology tools to support the potato value chain .

### The Problem

Potato farming in Kenya faces several challenges that hinder its potential to contribute significantly to food security and economic development. Key issues include:

- **Production Challenges**: Access to quality seeds is limited, leading to low yields of about 7.5 tons per hectare, significantly below the global average of 40 tons per hectare. Additionally, there is a high incidence of pests and diseases, poor soil nutrition understanding, and limited availability of new potato varieties .
- **Post-Harvest Handling**: Post-harvest losses range from 20% to 40% due to inadequate mechanization, manual grading, sorting, and insufficient storage facilities. This results in substantial economic losses for farmers .
- **Value Chain and Market Issues**: The potato value chain is poorly developed, with weak links between farmers and industry needs. Middlemen exploit farmers, and market linkages are inadequate. Additionally, consumer preferences and nutritional profiles of different potato varieties are not well understood .

### The Proposed Solution

The project proposes a comprehensive approach to address these challenges through the following solutions:

1. **High-Quality Seed and Climate-Smart Technologies**: By using high-quality seeds and implementing climate-smart farming techniques, the project aims to boost potato yields and resilience against pests and diseases .

2. **Enhanced Storage and Value Addition**: Developing better storage facilities and promoting value addition will help reduce post-harvest losses. This includes mechanization for sorting and grading, and introducing cottage industry equipment for diverse potato products .

3. **Market Access and ICT Integration**: The project will create a web application, SmartPotato, to provide farmers with access to market information, research, and expert advice. Additionally, a chatbot, Potato Variety Bot, will assist farmers with queries related to potato farming and the value chain .

4. **Mechanization**: Introducing and piloting technological innovations for various farming activities, from planting to processing, will enhance efficiency and productivity in the potato value chain .

5. **Nutrition and Health**: By improving the nutritional profiles of potato varieties and promoting their health benefits, the project aims to elevate the role of potatoes in food security and nutrition .

Through these targeted interventions, the Potato Value Chain Project seeks to uplift the livelihoods of Kenyan potato farmers, ensuring better income, improved nutrition, and overall economic development in the region.
