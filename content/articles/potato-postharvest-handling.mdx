### Potato Postharvest Handling and Value Addition: Enhancing Quality and Marketability

#### Overview

Potato farming in Kenya faces several challenges, especially when it comes to postharvest handling and adding value to the produce. Work Package 2 addresses these issues head-on by improving how potatoes are managed after harvest, and exploring innovative ways to add value to this crucial crop.

#### Goals

The primary aim of this work package is to enhance the quality, safety, and competitiveness of potato products in the market. By focusing on efficient postharvest handling and value addition, the project aims to reduce postharvest losses and improve the income and livelihoods of potato farmers in Kenya.

#### Key Activities

1. **Pre-treatments and Processing Methods**:

   - Various methods are being tested to process potatoes into flour, including oven drying, blanching followed by oven drying, boiling followed by oven drying, and freeze-drying. These methods help in determining the best approach for preserving potato quality and extending shelf life.

2. **Physical and Chemical Properties Analysis**:

   - The project evaluates several properties of processed potato flour, such as yield, color, particle size distribution, density, and compressibility index. These properties are crucial for ensuring that the processed products meet market standards.

3. **Functionality Testing**:

   - The team is assessing the swelling capacity, solubility index, and rheological properties of potato flour. This information is vital for developing new food products and applications that can increase the market value of potatoes.

4. **Food Applications**:

   - By exploring different ways to use potato flour in food products, the project aims to create diverse and high-value products that cater to consumer preferences and nutritional needs.

5. **Storage and Quality Maintenance**:
   - The project investigates how different storage conditions affect the specific gravity, dry matter content, and starch content of potatoes. This helps in understanding how to maintain the quality of potatoes over time and reduce spoilage.

#### Expected Outcomes

- **Improved Postharvest Handling**: Adoption of better handling practices to reduce losses and maintain the quality of potatoes from the field to the market.
- **Enhanced Value Addition**: Development of new potato-based products that can open up new markets and increase the profitability for farmers.
- **Increased Competitiveness**: Ensuring that Kenyan potatoes and potato products can compete favorably in both local and international markets.

#### Conclusion

Through Work Package 2, the project aims to transform the potato value chain in Kenya by enhancing postharvest handling and value addition. This will not only improve the economic outcomes for farmers but also contribute to food security and nutritional health in the region.
